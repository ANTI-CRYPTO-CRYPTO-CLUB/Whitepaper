The ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB was created because The Founder has dificulty meeting like minded crypto people in person.
Sometimes we can be chastised by family and friend for being involved in crypto, its hard to find people to talk about crypto with.
This is a global community that meets virtually and locally where we can network and learn about this space together.
Please read though the Whitepaper or join the conversation. Find us at wwww.anticryptocryptoclub.com
