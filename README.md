           WHAT IS THE ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB?   A decentralized member run social club.
Created as a social experiment aimed at bringing the crypto community together.    WHO IS THE ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB FOR?  If you were ANTI crypto
If you ever doubted crypto
If you thought crypto was dead
If you thought crypto was a scam
 This club is for you!   This club was created for you to meet and network with like minded people.
 The club is open to anyone who has become a crypto convert.  The ANTI TOKEN is built for everyone in crypto.  Now you see the future and want to be part of the club.   We all know what it’s like. You become a crypto convert only to wish you got in earlier and had more people to talk to about your passion.  
Think you missed the rocket that is going to the moon? Think again. At the ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB we are going to the moon together. When you are a part of the ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB you are part of a special community helping your fellow club members go to the moon.
  WHY THE ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB WAS CREATED?

The ACCC (A Triple C) and the ANTI TOKEN was created as a social experiment aimed at bringing the crypto community together in a positive way.  Where we can meet, make friends and discover the ever changing world of blockchain technology and decentralization.  The future direction of the club will be decided upon by Club Members.   This is where the social experiment comes into play.  To see how members can utilise the nature of a token and decentralization to create a social club of the future. There will be many questions to answer;   In a decentralized world how does a social community grow?  Can we lay a platform for future decentralized entities?

Do the creatives build dapps? The more creative and inventive the better.
Do the people who love to organize create world wide meet ups? Events should be a positive experience with a buzz in the air. It should be exciting and fun to be a part of this club. What would the benefits be for achieving a higher hodler tier?  How do the hodler tiers create governance and roles within the club? Do members have admin or organizer roles within the club? Does club leadership appoint these roles? How does the social club encourage non-members to join and become as excited about crypto as we are? Does this increase adoption of the ANTI TOKEN?  This is such an exciting and intriguing social experiment. 
Can decentralization bring us together and make our lives better?

We should be welcoming to people who currently doubt crypto or don’t know about crypto.  By creating a friendly environment they might see the future is decentralized and want to join the club too.   WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ANTI TOKEN?

The purpose of this token is firstly to provide proof of membership to the social club.  If you own over 69 ANTI TOKENS, then you are a member of the ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB. 
ANTI TOKENS are ERC-20 tokens operating on the Ethereum Blockchain.  The token is built for the crypto lover yet it is made simple for anyone to understand.   Owning over 69 ANTI TOKENS means you will be invited to club meetings, meet ups and major events. Whether virtual or in person.  If you feel like you want a place to meet people and have somewhere you belong, then this is were you should be. Club events could give you the inside scoop on all things crypto so you never miss out on going to the moon again. You could be a part of shaping the future of decentralized organizations.   As the club grows, the value of your membership increases as well. This will benefit early members and act as an incentive to bring new members into the club. 
 We should strive to have at least 1 major club convention per year. Club conventions are organized by volunteer members and members will pay their own way to attend.  Future use cases of the ANTI TOKEN are to be decided by ACCC members.   CLUB RULES AND VALUES
 We must be a welcoming and friendly community, with nothing but good intentions. 
We will grow a strong community spirit by helping each other out. The clubs direction must always be for the good of the members.  Creativity and kindness are at the core of the clubs values. 
These two traits are what will grow the club faster than you could ever imagine.   How will we know if the club is moving in the right direction? If the club is moving in the right direction we will see an increase in members adopting the ANTI TOKEN.  If it is moving in the wrong direction we will see members leaving the club. Market cycles might change the price of the token but accounts hodling more than 69 tokens will be the insight tracker in this regard.  We should always aim to improve. Just a 1% improvement per day has an enormous compounding effect.  To be a ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB member you must hold at least 69 ANTI TOKENS.   As long as attendees to meet ups are accompanied by an ACCC Member they are welcome to minor events as a guest.  Major events require attendees to be ACCC Members unless they are under 18 years of age.  People under 18 must be accompanied by a guardian who is a ACCC member.
 We must strive to create a safe place where wallet privacy and anonymity are respected. We do not want members wallets linked to them directly or leaked to the public. 
If the president or chairperson wishes to remain anonymous or go by a pseudonym they can. 
Future rules are decided by ACCC members.   Who knows what great inventions the community would come up with.
For example: Future club rules and general improvements could be voted on in a decentralised manner though a blockchain voting app. Each wallet of greater than 69 ANTI TOKENS would equal 1 vote.

All apps built for the club must be open source and peer reviewed prior to implementation.  
Virtual Club General Meetings can be hosted by the President, Chairman, Board of Directors or Club Captains.

69 ANTI TOKENS
 Supporter: <69 Tokens (Supporter of the cause - not directly invited to club events) Less than 69 ANTI TOKENS  If you sell your ANTI TOKENS and fall out of a tier, you must accumulate more ANTI TOKENS again to regain your standing in that tier. 
Hodling any amount of tokens within a tier range includes you in that tier. E.g. Bronze Club Members hodl between 100,000 and 499,999.999999999999999999 tokens.   Your tier/membership status will only matter at the time of event entry, as the only time is the now.
  Members could create ways for member tiers can be integrated into meet ups and events. Like first choice for booking events or exclusive access to pre or post event functions. Achieving a higher hodler tier could increase the quality of your networking at events.  For example: Create dapps to sign for entry with digital wallet whilst keeping anonymity and addresses private.
  SUPPLY SCHEDULE
 Total Supply/Max Supply: 69,069,069,069  
Initial supply: 17,267,267,267 (25%) 
Mid 2022: 34,534,534,534 at 50% of Max Supply (Minting 25% of max supply in one go)  Mid 2023: 51,801,801,801 at 75% of Max Supply (Minting 25 % of max supply in one go) 
Mid 2024: 69,069,069,069 at 100% of Max Supply (Minting final 25% of max supply in one go) 
This release schedule aims to increase adoption in the short term and benefit club members in the long term.  Members will be notified of exact token minting dates and times at least 1 month prior to supply increases. This is in the best interest of ACCC members and to keep the community informed. This could provide great opportunities to move into new member tier or accumulate more ANTI TOKENS. 

Once 100% of ANTI TOKENS are minted in mid 2024, ANTI TOKENS will fully owned by the community. 
The Founder will not hold onto any minted tokens and will put 100% of minted supply into circulation. The Founder will need to purchase tokens just like other club members. This is the fairest and most decentralized option.   
CONTRACT FEATURES
 ANTI TOKENS are non-burnable.
18 decimals.   Transfer type is unstoppable, transactions cannot be paused.  Supply type is capped. Owner cannot generate more tokens than the defined token cap.  Token recovery is unavailable to the owner of the contract.  Tokens sent to the contract in error will be unrecoverable.  Token Name: ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB Token Symbol: ANTI
Token Initial Supply: 17,267,267,267
Token Max Supply:  69,069,069,069  ANTI TOKENS are designed to be adopted by the crypto community. The initial purpose is to prove membership in the ANTI CRYPTO CRYPTO CLUB. Its secondary purpose will be decided by the members. 
Until mid 2024 the ANTI TOKEN will be inflationary in nature by the way of minting new tokens as described in the supply schedule. Once all tokens have been minted the ANTI TOKEN will become deflationary in nature due to lost tokens or tokens sent in error that are unrecoverable. Every lost token will make your membership more valuable.
